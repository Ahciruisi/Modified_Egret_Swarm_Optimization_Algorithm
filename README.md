To generate a table of fitnesses of the base and the modified algorithm for CEC2017 functions:
>> python new_vs_base_comparsion.py

To generate a similar table of fitness for some engineering applications:
>> python Applications.py

To view the fitness stats of the optimisers on engineering applications:
>> python ApplicationsResults.py

## Understanding the optimiser
`ESOModifiedVectorised.py` has detailed comments explaining each step.
